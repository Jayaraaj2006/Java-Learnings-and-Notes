Comparable vs Comparator in Java

1. Comparable Interface

Definition:
Comparable is used to define the natural ordering of objects.
The class itself decides how its objects should be compared.

Package:
java.lang

Method:
int compareTo(T o)

Key Characteristics:
- Sorting logic is inside the class
- Only one sorting order is possible
- The class must implement Comparable
- Used by default in sorting methods

Example:
class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    int marks;

    Student(int marks) {
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student s) {
        return this.marks - s.marks;
    }
}

Usage:
Collections.sort(studentList);

When to Use:
- When there is one natural order
- Examples: ID, roll number, age


2. Comparator Interface

Definition:
Comparator is used to define custom or multiple sorting orders.
The sorting logic is written outside the class.

Package:
java.util

Method:
int compare(T o1, T o2)

Key Characteristics:
- Sorting logic is separate from the class
- Supports multiple sorting strategies
- Original class need not be modified
- Useful for flexible sorting

Example:
class SortByMarks implements Comparator<Student> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return s1.marks - s2.marks;
    }
}

Usage:
Collections.sort(studentList, new SortByMarks());

When to Use:
- When multiple sorting orders are required
- Examples: by marks, by name, by age


3. Differences Between Comparable and Comparator

Comparable:
- Package: java.lang
- Method: compareTo()
- Sorting logic: inside class
- Class modification required
- Single sorting order

Comparator:
- Package: java.util
- Method: compare()
- Sorting logic: outside class
- No class modification required
- Multiple sorting orders


4. Memory Trick

Comparable: I can compare myself
Comparator: Someone else compares me


5. Interview One-Liner

Comparable defines natural ordering.
Comparator defines custom ordering.
