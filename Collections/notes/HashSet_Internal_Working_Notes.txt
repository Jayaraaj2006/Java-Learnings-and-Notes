HASHSET – SIMPLE NOTES (BEGINNER FRIENDLY)

1. What is HashSet?
HashSet is a collection in Java that stores UNIQUE elements.
It does NOT maintain insertion order or sorting order.

2. How HashSet works internally (simple idea)
Think of HashSet as many boxes (called buckets).

When you add an element:
- Java calls hashCode() of the element
- hashCode decides which bucket to use
- Java checks inside that bucket

3. Duplicate check in HashSet
HashSet uses two methods:
- hashCode()
- equals()

Process:
- Same hashCode → go to same bucket
- equals() returns true → duplicate → NOT added
- equals() returns false → element is added

4. Why no duplicates?
Before adding any element, HashSet checks:
existingElement.equals(newElement)
If true → duplicate → ignored

5. Why HashSet has no order?
Elements are placed based on hashCode.
hashCode does not follow insertion or sorting order.
So order is NOT guaranteed.

6. Important rules to remember
- HashSet allows only unique elements
- Uses hashCode() and equals()
- Order is unpredictable
- Internally backed by HashMap

7. Simple example
HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(5);
set.add(5);
set.add(10);

Output:
[5, 10]

Reason:
Duplicate 5 is ignored.

8. One-line summary
HashSet stores elements in buckets using hashCode() and avoids duplicates using equals().
